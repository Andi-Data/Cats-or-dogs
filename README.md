# Cats-or-dogs

**Project Overview: Pet Ownership Preferences in the UK**

**Objective:** The primary goal of this project was to analyze pet ownership preferences across different regions in the UK, focusing on the ratio of cats to dogs per household and the correlation between pet populations and human populations.

**Scope:**

Cats to Dogs Ratio: Calculated the ratio of cats per household to dogs per household, grouped by UK regions.

Correlation Analysis: Examined the relationship between pet populations (cats and dogs) and human populations using scatterplots and R-squared values.

**Methodology:**

Data Collection: Utilized a dataset containing information on the number of cats and dogs per household and the total number of households in various UK regions.

Data Processing: Cleaned and merged the data to ensure consistency and accuracy using Python libraries such as pandas.

Statistical Analysis: Conducted correlation analysis to identify the strength of the relationship between pet populations and human populations.

Visualization: Created scatterplots using matplotlib to visualize the relationship between pet populations and human populations.

**Key Findings:**

Cats to Dogs Ratio: The ratio of cats per household to dogs per household is fairly consistent across different regions, indicating no significant regional preference for either pet.

Correlation Between Pet and Human Populations: There is a weak positive correlation between pet populations and human populations, with an R-squared value of 0.24, suggesting that while there is some correlation, it is not strong.

**Recommendations:**

Regional Pet Ownership: Since the ratio of cats to dogs is consistent across regions, pet ownership campaigns and resources can be uniformly distributed without regional bias.

Further Research: Investigate other factors that might influence pet ownership preferences, such as socioeconomic status, urban vs. rural settings, and cultural influences.

**Conclusion:** This project provided valuable insights into pet ownership trends across the UK, revealing that all regions have a similar preference for dogs over cats. The findings contribute to a better understanding of pet demographics and can inform future studies and public policies related to pet ownership.
